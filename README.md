# PinEosCopier

This was created for a friend whom was a Dispatcher for a delivery service, in which his only knowledge of where his drivers were was an address, for each of the routes. This wasn't efficient in helping him route help from other drivers.

This basically takes the route numbers(changes daily) from one Excel workbook, and uses it to search a second workbook for those routes, and grabs the last address to place into a third workbook, that is used to upload to a website for placing pins on a map. It also sets up an internal driver statistics sheet with, Name, route, and stop count.
